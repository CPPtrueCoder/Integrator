Integrator
=====================
The Integrator relised on numerical method integration by Dormand-Prince.
------------
### System undepended of count equations

For using this code , u must download gbuplot from 
   [GnuPlot site](https://sourceforge.net/projects/gnuplot/files/gnuplot/)

In future we fix this fail and u can use it without some downloads. 
We think that we will use :
QCustomPlot for this project. 
And all that you need to do : write code for your system.

### What project contains 
1. Files Object.h Object.cpp 
   Files for create math-model of differential equations.
2. IntegratorDP.h, IntegratorDP.cpp 
   Files of realization method Dormand-Prince.


Updates is comming soon
